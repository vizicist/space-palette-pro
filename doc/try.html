<h2>Buy all the parts</h2>
The <code>parts.ods</code> file is a spreadsheet that lists all of the non-wood parts needed.
Links are provided to the places (mostly Amazon) where you can buy each piece.

<h2>Cut the wood pieces</h2>
The <a href="cnc"><code>cnc</code></a> directory contains the CNC files for the wood pieces.
The <a href="cnc/cnclist.txt"><code>cnclist.txt</code></a> file contains a list that shows for each piece the number of copies needed, their thickness,
and the CNC filename.

<h2>Put together the controller</h2>
