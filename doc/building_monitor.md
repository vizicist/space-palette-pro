Put the 4 Sensel Morphs in place.

Put Layer4 on.  Note how it overlaps the Morphs, keeping them in place.
NOTE: this picture doesn't show the cables but they should be there.

Put the Waveshare 10.1" touchscreen into place, face down.

Make sure the on/off switch on the touchscreen is on.

Put Layer5 on.  Make sure all the cables are routed so that all the layers lay flat.
<img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6292.jpg">
<p>
<hr><hr>
Put Layer6 on.
<img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6293.jpg">
<p>
Note how some of the cables are routed through gaps in Layer5.

Attach two 1-foot USB cables to the monitor, and connect them to one of the USB hubs, as shown.  Also attach the 3-foot HDMI cable to the monitor, as shown.

Attach the four cables from the Morphs to the second USB hub, and route the cables so that all the layers are flat.  You may want to tape the cables down so they don't get in the way when you add the final layer.

Before you add Layer6, attach the 2 metal L-angle brackets to it, as shown.  Then, add Layer6, routing the three cables (two USB cables and one HDMI cable) through its hole.

Finally, screw the bronze caps onto the 5 bolts.  It may be a snug fit.
