<h1>Building the Base of the Space Palette Pro</h1>
These are the steps to building the base,
assuming you've collected all the necessary parts.

Screw 5 furniture pads into the base bottom.

Use 1/4-20 1" bolts to attache the L-angle brackets to both of the side panels.
Note carefully which holes in the brackets are used for the bolts.
In particular, the middle shelf bracket is pushed a little more toward one side (the front),
compared to the top and bottom brackets.
Note make sure that the orientation of the two side panels is reversed when you add the brackets.

Attach the mid and top shelves to one of the side panels.
Again, note how the middle shelf is pushed toward one side (which is the front of the base),
so that it doesn't collide with the vertical bracket on the other (back) side.
Assuming the shelves are 1/4" thick, you can use 3/4" bolts rather than 1".

Attach the bottom of the base, with the bolt heads pointing toward the floor.
The bottom is not symmetric, so make sure that the front of the base bottom has a 1/4" gap
(as shown in the second picture)
and the back of the base bottom has a 1/2" gap (as shown in the third picture)
