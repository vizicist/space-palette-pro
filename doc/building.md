<h1>Buy all the parts</h1>
The <a href="parts.ods"><code>parts.ods</code></a> file is an <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html">OpenDoc Calc</a> spreadsheet listing all of the non-wood parts needed.
Links are provided to the places (mostly Amazon) where you can buy each piece.

<h1>Cut the wood pieces</h1>
The <a href="cnc"><code>cnc</code></a> directory contains the CNC files for the wood pieces.
The <a href="cnc/cnclist.txt"><code>cnclist.txt</code></a> file contains a list that shows for each piece the number of copies needed, their thickness,
and the CNC filename.
