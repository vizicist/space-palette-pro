<p>
<ul>
<li>Buy all the parts
<li>Cut the wood pieces
<li>Put together the controller
<li>Put together the monitor
<li>Put together the base
<li>Attached the monitor and controller to the base
<li>Install commercial software
<li>Install open-source software
</ul>
Each of those steps is described below.
<p>

<h1>Buy all the parts</h1>
The <a href="parts.ods"><code>parts.ods</code></a> file is a
spreadsheet listing all of the non-wood parts needed.
<a href="parts.pdf"><code>parts.pdf</code></a> is a large printable version, and
if you download this PDF and display it in your browser, the links will
be enabled and point to the places (mostly Amazon) where you can buy each piece.

<h1>Cut the wood pieces</h1>
A list of the wood pieces with pictures of each can be found in <a href="../dxf/list.md"><code>dxf/list.md</code></a>.
The <a href="../dxf/list.txt"><code>dxf/list.txt</code></a> file is a more concise list
that shows for each piece the quantity, thickness, and DXF filename.
Most of these pieces should be baltic birch, but some of them can be another material, particularly
the inner layers of the monitor and controller.  For example, MDF is an alternative to baltic birch at <a href="https://sendcutsend.com">sendcutsend.com</a>, a mail-order CNC service.
In the <a href="parts.pdf">parts list</a>,
the prices are taken from <a href="https://sendcutsend.com">sendcutsend.com</a>,
using MDF for the inner layers.
For the top layer of the controller (SPP_Layer1_face.dxf) and the top layer
of the monitor (SPP_MonLayer1_face.dxf), you might consider using
<a href="https://www.buyappleply.com/">ApplePly</a> for a nicer wood appearance.
