<h1>Building the Controller of the Space Palette Pro</h1>
These are the steps to building just the controller,
assuming you've collected all the necessary parts.

Here's all the parts laid out

Put the face layer (the top and visible part of the controller) face down, with the bronze 1.57" connector bolts inserted.

Put Layer2 on.  Make sure it's oriented as shown.

Here's a closeup of the alignment in one of the corners.

Put Layer3 on.  Note the small differences between Layer2 and Layer3.

Put the 4 Sensel Morphs in place.
NOTE: these pictures don't show it, but you should attach the four right-angle mini USB cables to the four Morphs.

<p>
<hr><hr>
Put Layer4 on.  Note how it overlaps the Morphs, keeping them in place.
NOTE: this picture doesn't show the cables but they should be there.

<p>
<hr><hr>
Put the Waveshare 10.1" touchscreen into place, face down.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6284.jpg">
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6285.jpg">
<p>
Make sure the on/off switch on the touchscreen is on.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6294.jpg">
<p>
<hr><hr>
Put Layer5 on.  Make sure all the cables are routed so that all the layers lay flat.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6292.jpg">
<p>
<hr><hr>
Put Layer6 on.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6293.jpg">
<p>
Note how some of the cables are routed through gaps in Layer5.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6296.jpg">
<p>
<hr><hr>
Attach two 1-foot USB cables to the monitor, and connect them to one of the USB hubs, as shown.  Also attach the 3-foot HDMI cable to the monitor, as shown.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6297.jpg">
<p>
<hr><hr>
Attach the four cables from the Morphs to the second USB hub, and route the cables so that all the layers are flat.  You may want to tape the cables down so they don't get in the way when you add the final layer.

This is a picture with everything in place, just before adding the final back layer.

Before you add Layer6, attach the 2 metal L-angle brackets to it, as shown, using short 1/4"-20 bolts.
Note their orientation carefully, in terms of which side the L is on, and which holes the bolts go through.
<p><br>
Then, add Layer6, routing the three cables (two USB cables and one HDMI cable) through its hole.
<p><br>
Finally, screw the bronze caps onto the 5 bolts.  It may be a snug fit.
