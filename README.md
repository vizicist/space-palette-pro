This repo contains open-source specs allowing you to completely reproduce the Space Palette Pro,
a visual music instrument on which you play music and graphics simultaneously by finger painting on
pressure sensitive pads.  Here are some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1x5BrCuc9yP6Z52XA">photos and videos</a> from a recent event where it was enjoyed.  Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/HDtxEyCI_zc?t=362">improvised performance</a> using it.
This repo contains:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A list of everything you need: electronics, hardware, software
<li>The open-source Palette software (from <a href="https://github.com/vizicist/palette">github.com/vizicist/palette</a>)
<li>DXF data for CNC cutting the pieces of the base, monitor, and controller.
<li>Instructions for putting it all together.
</ul>

<h2>Trying it out</h2>
<p>
If you satisfy the minimum software and hardware requirements,
you can follow these instructions for <a href="doc/trying_it_out.md">trying it out</a>.
In some cases that may be all you want, but a key aspect of the Space Palette Pro is the ergonomic placement of the four Morphs and touchscreen, so if you like what you can do with the software, you should definitely consider building at least the controller to get the best experience.

<h2>Building just the controller</h2>
<p>
If you've already tried it out with four Sensel Morphs, you already have most of the things
needed for the controller.  All you need in addition are the wood pieces, USB hubs, the 10.1" touchscreen, and cables.
<a href="doc/building_controller.md">Building the controller</a> by itself gives you something that
would work well for doing performances.

<h2>Building a complete and standalone Space Palette Pro</h2>
<p>
Here are the instructions for <a href="doc/building.md">building a complete and standalone Space Palette Pro</a> from scratch.
The cost of all the <a href="doc/parts.pdf">raw materials</a> for an uncompromised and complete instrument
including the computer is around $8K.
This is no-compromise single-item pricing of all materials - cost-reductions
and other adjustments are certainly possible.
For example, the speaker system is unnecessary
if you already have an amplifier and speakers.
Four sets of headphones and a headphone amp may not be needed either.
You might have access to a large CNC machine so you can avoid
paying someone else to CNC all the wood.
