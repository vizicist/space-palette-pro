This repo contains open-source specs allowing you to completely reproduce the Space Palette Pro,
a visual music instrument on which you play music and graphics simultaneously by finger painting on
pressure sensitive pads.  Here are some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1x5BrCuc9yP6Z52XA">photos and videos</a> from a recent event where it was enjoyed.  Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/HDtxEyCI_zc?t=362">improvised performance</a> using it.

<h1>Building your own Space Palette Pro</h1>
This repo contains all the information needed to build a complete instrument:
<p>
<ul>
<li>DXF data for cutting the wood pieces of the base, monitor, and controller.
<li>A list of everything you need: electronics, hardware, software
<li>Instructions for putting together the base, monitor, and controller
<li>Installer for the open-source software (<a href="https://github.com/vizicist/palette">github.com/vizicist/palette</a>)
<li>Instructions for installing and configuring all the software
</ul>
<p>
The cost of all the <a href="doc/parts.pdf">raw materials</a> for an uncompromised and complete instrument
including the computer is around $8K.
This is no-compromise single-item materials pricing - cost-reductions
and other adjustments (e.g. if you have some of the pieces already)
are certainly possible.
The cost of just the controller (4 Morphs, a touchscreen, misc. parts, commercial software, and wood) is around $3K.
